Program 1 - GraphDisplay
5/28/13

This program starts by asking the user the input text file to read the node 
and edge information from. It then draws them on the screen based on the 
color, shape, and position in the input text file. The drawn edges do not
intersect the nodes, but there are no arrow heads at the end points. The
program is able to resize properly without skewing and the nodes maintain
their original size and position.
